### before attempting to use a custom resolution you will need to apply the custom resolution with your GPU driver software ~ [See Guide](https://github.com/dillacorn/win-glaze-dots/blob/main/amd_software_settings.md)

For games requiring borderless windowed mode for stretched fullscreen resolutions, I use [nircmd scripts](https://github.com/dillacorn/win-glaze-dots/blob/main/UserProfile/scripts) to quickly switch resolutions before launching specific games. I find 1600x1024 (16:10) strikes a good balanceâ€”offering stretch without overdoing it, while still feeling natural when switching back to 16:9. While 1728x1080 (16:10) is sharper, the difference is minimal, and 1600x1024 provides better frame rate consistency. 1440x1080 (4:3) is also an option for stronger stretch.

### To use nircmd launch it with GlazeWM shortcut `ALT+shift+m` ~ [See GlazeWM Config](https://github.com/dillacorn/win-glaze-dots/blob/d8667c1f86257113a0b3ad13b69d28e74fd226f0/UserProfile/.glzr/glazewm/config.yaml#L415)
